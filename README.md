# UNdyslexify

## Inspiration 
A reading disability is a condition in which a sufferer displays difficulty reading. Examples of reading disabilities include: developmental dyslexia, alexia and hyperlexia. Often people with visual differences find reading difficult as well.

Dyslexia is a learning disorder that directly affects reading, writing, spelling, and speaking skills. It is the most common learning disability, affecting as much as 17% of children in the United States. People with dyslexia typically have trouble reading fluently. They often read slowly and make mistakes that can impact how well they comprehend what they read.

As such, our team has created a Chrome extension to make reading webpages easier!

## What it does

UNdyslexify is an inclusively designed plugin that implements techniques to improve reading comprehension for new readers, language learners, and people with learning differences such as dyslexia.

It provides various options to modify websites in order to make the written content easier to read. It improves readability and better visual impact for all readers, but especially those with dyslexia. Users can customize the settings in order to find the most appropriate appearance that suits the individual user. 

It provides the following features:

1. Changing Fonts : Change the font of the websites to Open-Dyslexic font family which is a font created to increase readability for readers with dyslexia. The user can customize the font type as well as size.
2. Reading Ruler : Provides a full-width reading-ruler that follows the mouse cursor so that the user can easily read the content in the current line. The user can customize the ruler height.
3. Spacing Adjust : Adjust the spacing between different letters and words on the website for clearer differentiation.
4. Line Height Adjust : Adjusts the spacing between different lines of text on the webpage. The user can customize line height according to their liking.
5. Listen and Visualize Word : This feature allows the user to listen to difficult words aloud and also displays a picture for those words in order to make learning easier through listening and visualization.
